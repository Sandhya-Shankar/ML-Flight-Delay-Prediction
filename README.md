# ML-Flight-Delay-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting flight delays using US flight data. Various classification and regression models were explored, ultimately classifying delays into classes such as <30 minutes, <1 hour, etc. A simple website was developed using Flask, integrating Python scripts containing machine learning models with HTML/CSS frontend. Additionally, a weather API was utilized to extract relevant weather inputs for enhancing prediction accuracy.

Features:
Prediction of flight delays using machine learning models.
Classification of delays into specific time intervals.
Integration of Flask for web development.
Utilization of a weather API to incorporate weather data for improved predictions.

Technologies Used:
Python
Flask
HTML/CSS
Machine Learning (Classification and Regression)
Weather API integration
